            NEW DELHI (AP) — India and Saudi Arabia agreed Monday to expand trade and security ties, two days after
            their leaders and others attending a Group of 20 summit announced a new railways and port corridor deal that
            will link India, Middle East and Europe.

            Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met in New Delhi and
            chaired a meeting of the India-Saudi Arabia Strategic Partnership Council. The two leaders discussed issues
            ranging from energy security, trade and investment to defense, health care and food security, India’s
            foreign ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.

            The India-Saudi Arabia Strategic Partnership Council, established in 2019, serves as a platform between the
            two countries to increase ties.

            During last week’s G20 summit, India, Saudi Arabia, the United States, the European Union and other
            countries announced an ambitious rail and shipping corridor that will link India with the Middle East and
            Europe in a bid to strengthen economic growth and political cooperation.
            Experts see it as alternative to China’s own nation-spanning infrastructure program.

            In a televised press statement, Modi called Saudi Arabia one of India’s “most important strategic partners.”

            He said the “corridor will not only connect the two countries, but will also strengthen economic
            cooperation, energy development and digital connectivity between Asia, West Asia and Europe.”

            Ahead of the talks, Prince Mohammed was accorded a ceremonial welcome at the Rashtrapati Bhavan Presidential
            Palace in New Delhi. He is on a three-day trip to India that included the G20 summit.

            India views Saudi Arabia as one of its most important strategic partners in the Middle East. Trade between
            the countries stood at over $52.8 billion in the fiscal year 2022-2023.
            “The Crown Prince congratulated India for a very successful G20 meeting with a lot of major outcomes in the
            meeting… The two sides expressed their happiness at the launching of the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor…
            The PM also congratulated the Kingdom on becoming a full member of the BRICS,” said Sayeed.

            “Both sides welcomed the key initiatives taken by both governments to improve business climate, simplify and
            rationalise rules for relaxing foreign direct investment norms, the ease of doing business and reforms
            undertaken by India. Both sides discussed further facilitation of investments from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign
            wealth fund and its portfolio companies,” said a joint statement.

            Both sides also noted the ongoing discussions on Bilateral Investment Treaty, Double Taxation Avoidance
            Agreement and Mutual Legal Assistance in Custom matters, it said.
            In light of the economic transformation that both countries are witnessing through Saudi Arabia’s Vision
            2030 and India’s flagship initiatives such as Make in India, Start-up India and Digital India, both sides
            expressed their interest in strengthening economic ties and exploring different investment opportunities in
            various strategic sectors, it said.

            Both sides agreed to explore opportunities for cooperation in payment systems, including the acceptance of
            RuPAY cards in Saudi Arabia for the benefit of the Indian community in general and more particularly the
            Haj/ Umrah pilgrims, the statement said.

            “The importance of trade in the bilateral relationship was recognised. Both sides praised the burgeoning
            trade ties and noted that bilateral trade has increased to more than US$ 52 billion in 2022-23, marking a
            growth of more than 23%. Both sides also noted that India is the second largest trade partner of Saudi
            Arabia, while Saudi Arabia is the fourth largest trade partner of India,” it said.
