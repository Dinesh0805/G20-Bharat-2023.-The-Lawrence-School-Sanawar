            I'm very pleased to have returned to India and participated in the G20 Summit.

            The G20 is such an important body. It represents 85 per cent of global GDP. And that's why what happened
            here matters. That matters at home as well. Because we know that inflation is a global problem, and
            international engagement is part of the solution.

            Whether it's climate change, energy, resources or supply chains, being part of these conversations means
            that Australia gets to shape the solutions.

            Today, I spoke in the G20, one of the sessions, a forum focused on accelerating climate action and reaching
            global net zero emissions together. It's important to recognise there is no debate globally about the
            science of climate change. The science is settled. The debate at these forums is about what actions should
            be taken, and how the world can move forward together. I spoke with G20 leaders on the pace and scale of
            global energy transitions and on support for the development of clean energy markets.

            On the sidelines of the G20 today, I also marked the 10th anniversary of MIKTA. This brings together, if you
            like, our medium-size powers, Mexico, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Turkiye, and Australia.

            Cooperation at meetings like these is very important. And it was quite a constructive discussion. And I
            thank President Widodo for the role that he has played as the chair of MIKTA.

            In my bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Kishida, I discussed the ambitious plans between our countries,
            including what we're doing with the Reciprocal Access Agreement. That's about increased engagement
            interoperability of our defence forces going forward. I hosted the naval leaders of Japan, India, Australia,
            and the United States recently in Sydney, as part of Operation Malabar. We also discussed the plan when our
            country is not just about existing energy, but new energy as well, going forward. And that was a very
            constructive discussion.

            On the sidelines, I have also had discussions with the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, last
            night, as well as Rishi Sunak last night about AUKUS. The discussion with the European Commission was about
            advancing the Australia-European Free Trade Agreement, and whether we can get that completed this year.

            I also had discussions with leaders from Singapore, Argentina, the United States, Italy, Germany, Brazil,
            Netherlands, and South Africa. In addition to that, I thanked President Jokowi today for taking up the
            request from Australia that we fast track the approval, again, of our cattle exports to Indonesia. This was
            an issue about lumpy skin disease. We have provided evidence that Australia is lumpy skin disease free. That
            ban was lifted in Malaysia a few days ago, and then it was lifted yesterday. This is an important industry
            for Australia. When you have, it's not like you can find a replacement market straightaway, so it was really
            important to be resolved quickly. And I thank Indonesia for that. It's another example of the practical
            results that come from building relationships with people. And President Widodo and I certainly have a very
            positive relationship. And I was very pleased.

            Can I congratulate Prime Minister Modi and India for guiding the G20 to deliver a consensus Leaders'
            Declaration. The Declaration covers important global economic issues which require coordination by this
            group of major economies, including action on climate change in energy, including a commitment to global
            peaking by 2025, and tripling renewable energy technology capacity, multilateral development bank reform to
            better support sustainable development and action on climate change, including for the countries in our
            region. The strongest messaging yet from the G20 on achieving gender equality. And that has been a real
            theme of this afternoonâ€™s second session of the G20 meeting.

            Importantly, the G20 has delivered a strong consensus message on Russia's war on Ukraine. That message is
            very strong language and it is the strongest language yet to be agreed by the international community. Very
            clear statements like - we highlighted the human suffering and negative added impacts of the war in Ukraine,
            with regard to global food and energy security supply chains, macro financial stability, inflation and
            growth, which is complicated, the policy environment for countries. A backdrop of this G20 has been the
            impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the impact it's having on the global economy, on food
            security, as well as obviously the devastating impact of this war on the people of Ukraine. Speaker after
            speaker reiterated the need for Russia to stop this war which it can do today, and the need to make sure
            that action was clearly heard. Time for a couple of questions.
