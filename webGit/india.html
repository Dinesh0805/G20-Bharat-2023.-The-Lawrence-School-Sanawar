                        significant milestone in its global leadership role. With, India taking the presidency for the
                        first time, it is steering discussions and initiatives among the world's major economies to
                        address complex challenges. With its diverse economy, technological prowess, and commitment to
                        sustainable development, India is poised to bring unique perspectives to the table. During the
                        presidency, India is focusing on various issues like inclusive growth, digital innovation,
                        climate resilience, and equitable global health access. By leveraging its presidency, India is
                        fostering collaborative solutions that not only benefit its own population but contribute to the
                        broader global well-being, reinforcing its spirit of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ or the ‘World is
                        One Family’.</p>

                    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style="font-size: 18px;">India will convene the G20 Leaders' Summit
                        for the first time in 2023, as 43 Heads of Delegations- the largest ever in the G20–will
                        participate in the final New Delhi Summit in September later this year. As a nation committed to
                        democracy and multilateralism, India's presidency will be a significant milestone as it seeks to
                        find practical global solutions for the benefit of all and embody the idea of "Vasudhaiva
                        Kutumbakam," or "the world is one family."

                        The G20 Summit is held annually with a rotating presidency, and in 2023, India will hold the
                        presidency. The group does not have a permanent secretariat and is supported by the previous,
                        current, and future holders of the presidency, known as the troika. In 2023, the troika consists
                        of Indonesia, Brazil, and India.

                        This summit will conclude a series of meetings throughout the year, with potential host cities
                        for meetings from December 2022 to February 2023 including Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Chennai,
                        Guwahati, Indore, Jodhpur, Khajuraho, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Pune, Rann of Kutch, Surat,
                        Thiruvananthapuram, and Udaipur.

                        Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which translates to "One Earth, One Family, One Future," is the theme of
                        India's G20 presidency. It is inspired from the Maha Upanishad, an old Sanskrit scripture. The
                        theme fundamentally highlights the importance of all life—human, animal, plant, and
                        microorganism—as well as their interdependence on Earth and across the universe. The theme also

                        The G20 Presidency also heralds for India the start of "Amritkaal," a 25-year period commencing
                        from the 75th anniversary of its independence on August 15, 2022, leading up to the centenary of

                        The menu began with an introduction of how, for all its diversity, India is connected by taste.
                        After the welcome dinner on Friday featured a mix of popular North-Indian dishes along with a
                        few global ones - think Roasted Almond Soup, Pasta Salad, Paneer Lababdar, and more - the dinner
                        was proudly Indian with regional breads like Mumbai’s ubiquitous Pao and Kashmir’s sweet
                        cardamom-flavoured Bakarkhani rounding up one of the courses.

                        One common thread throughout the four courses that celebrated the autumn season, though, was the
                        humble millet; apt considering the Indian government is promoting 2023 as the International Year
                        of Millets. There was a section in the menu explaining their importance and nutritional value as
                        well.For the dishes, local ingredients were given a modern makeover, perhaps to suit the palette
                        of the heads of state and delegates from around the world. For instance, the first course
                        ‘Paatram’ was a contemporary rendition of chaat, with foxtail millet leaf crisps topped by a
                        yoghurt sphere and a spiced chutney.

                        The main course, ‘Vanavarnam’, had a jackfruit galette served with glazed forest mushrooms,
                        little millet crisps, and curry-leaf tossed Kerala red rice.

                        Dessert, called ‘Madhurima’, consisted of a cardamom-scented barnyard millet pudding finished
                        with seasonal fig-peach compote and ambemohar rice crisps.

                        To top off the dinner, drinks included Kashmiri Kahwa, filter coffee, and Darjeeling tea, a nod
                        to three popular beverages of the country.

                        Of course, no quintessential Indian meal can be complete without the after-dinner treat – paan -
                        and here, guests got to savour a chocolate version of the same.
