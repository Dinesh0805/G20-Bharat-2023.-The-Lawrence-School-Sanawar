                    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style="font-size: 18px;">The Summit of G20 Finance Ministers and
                        Central Bank Governors, who prepare the leaders' summit and implement their decisions, was
                        created as a response both to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and to a growing recognition
                        that key emerging countries were not adequately included in the core of global economic
                        discussion and governance. Additionally, G20 summits of heads of state or government were held.
                        <br><br>
                        After the 2008 debut summit in Washington, DC, G20 leaders met twice a year: in London and
                        Pittsburgh in 2009, and in Toronto and Seoul in 2010.
                        <br><br>
                        Since 2011, when France chaired and hosted the G20, the summits have been held only once a
                        year. The 2016 summit was held in Hangzhou, China, the 2017 summit was held in Hamburg,
                        Germany, the 2018 summit was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the 2019 summit was held in Osaka,
                        Japan, the 2020 summit was scheduled in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia but it was held virtually due to
                        Covid-19, the 2021 summit was held in Rome, Italy and the 2022 summit was held in Bali,
                        Indonesia.
                        <br><br>
                        Several other ministerial-level G20 meetings have been held since 2010. Agriculture ministerial
                        meetings were conducted in 2011 and 2012; meetings of foreign ministers were held in 2012 and
                        2013; trade ministers met in 2012 and 2014, and employment ministerial meetings have taken place
                        annually since 2010.
                        <br><br>
                        In 2012, the G20 Ministers of Tourism and Heads of Delegation of G20 member countries and other
                        invited States, as well as representatives from the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC),
                        World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and other organisations in the Travel & Tourism sector met in
                        Mérida, Mexico, on May 16 at the 4th G20 meeting and focused on 'Tourism as a means to Job
                        Creation'. As a result of this meeting and The World Travel & Tourism Council's Visa Impact
                        Research, later on the Leaders of the G20, convened in Los Cabos on 18–19 June, would recognise
                        the impact of Travel & Tourism for the first time. That year, the G20 Leaders Declaration added
                        the following statement: "We recognise the role of travel and tourism as a vehicle for job
                        creation, economic growth and development, and, while recognizing the sovereign right of States
                        to control the entry of foreign nationals, we will work towards developing travel facilitation
                        initiatives in support of job creation, quality work, poverty reduction and global growth."
                        <br><br>
                        In March 2014, the former Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop, when Australia was hosting
                        the 2014 G20 summit in Brisbane, proposed to ban Russia from the summit over its annexation of
                        Ukrainian Crimea. The BRICS foreign ministers subsequently reminded Bishop that "the
                        custodianship of the G20 belongs to all Member States equally and no one Member State can
                        unilaterally determine its nature and character."
                        <br><br>
                        In 2016, the G20 framed its commitment to the 2030 Agenda, Sustainable Development Goals in
                        three key themes; the promotion of strong sustainable and balanced growth; protection of the
                        planet from degradation; and furthering co-operation with low-income and developing countries.
                        At the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, members agreed on an action plan and issued a high level
                        principles document to member countries to help facilitate the agenda's implementation.

                        Japan hosted the 2019 summit, The 2020 summit was to be held in Saudi Arabia, but was
                        instead held virtually on 21–22 November 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic under the presidency
                        of Saudi Arabia. 2021 G20 Rome summit which was held in Rome, the capital city of Italy, on
                        30–31 October 2021.

                        Indonesia held the G20 presidency from 1 December 2021 to 30 November 2022. During its
                        presidency, Indonesia focused on the global COVID-19 pandemic and how to collectively overcome
                        the challenges related to it. The three priorities of Indonesia's G20 presidency were global
                        health architecture, digital transformations, and sustainable energy transitions.
                        <br><br>
                        India has held the G20 presidency since 1 December 2022, with its presidency's theme being
                        Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam or "वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्" in Sanskrit or translated as "One Earth, One
                        Family, One Future'" in English and the summit was held from 9 September 2023 to 10
                        September 2023 at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi. In an interview on 26 August 2023, Prime
                        Minister Narendra Modi expressed optimism about the G20 countries' evolving agenda under India's
                        presidency, shifting toward a human-centric development approach that aligns with the concerns
                        of the Global South, including addressing climate change, debt restructuring through the G20's
                        Common Framework for debt, and a strategy for regulation of global cryptocurrencies. G20 became
                        G20 by the inclusion of African Union, it is also the first inclusion since 1999.
