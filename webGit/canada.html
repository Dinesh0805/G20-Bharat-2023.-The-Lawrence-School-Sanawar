            Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and his entire delegation have been forced to extend their stay in
            New Delhi for the G20 summit by an extra day after his aircraft broke down, Canadian officials confirmed.
            Trudeau arrived in India for the meeting of the leaders of 20 leading economies on Friday.
            He was due to return home on Sunday after laying a wreath at a memorial to Indian independence leader
            Mahatma Gandhi, but a mechanical fault kept him in India overnight.The Canadian High Commission in New Delhi
            referred AFP to a statement from Trudeau’s office saying that the Canadian air force, which operates the
            plane, had informed the delegation it “was experiencing technical difficulties”.
            “These issues are not fixable overnight, our delegation will be staying in India until alternative
            arrangements are made,” it added.
            Canada’s CTV identified the plane as an Airbus, saying it was not clear when it would be able to return,
            adding it “isn’t the first time” it had had problems.
            Trudeau’s presence at the G20 summit was lower-key than some of his G7 counterparts, and came against a
            backdrop of tensions between his government and host India over Ottawa’s handling of rightwing Sikh
            separatists.
            New Delhi accuses Ottawa of turning a blind eye to the activities of radical Sikh nationalists who seek a
            separate Sikh homeland in northern India.
            Trudeau is not the only world figure to have been a victim of problems with an aircraft issues in recent
            months. In August, Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was forced to abandon a trip to Oceania
            after a problem with her government plane twice forced it to return to Abu Dhabi.
            In June, the New Zealand defence force plane ferrying the country’s prime minister, Chris Hipkins, to China
            was judged so unreliable that a backup plane flew in reserve. Former prime ministers Dame Jacinda Ardern and
            Sir John Key have previously become stuck during trips around the world after RNZAF Boeing 757s and Hercules
            aircraft broke down.India is an 'extraordinarily important' economy and an 'important partner' of Canada in
            a range of sectors including fighting climate change and creating economic growth, Canadian Prime Minister
            Justin Trudeau said on Sunday. His comments at a media briefing came shortly after he held talks with Prime
            Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G20 Summit."At the same time, we are always there to prevent
            violence and to push back against hatred. I think on the issue of the community, it is important to remember
            that the actions of the few do not represent the entire community or Canada," Trudeau said.
