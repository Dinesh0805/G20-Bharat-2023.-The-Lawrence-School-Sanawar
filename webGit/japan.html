            Japan sees India as an “indispensable” partner in the Indo-Pacific and is keen to develop deeper defence
            cooperation to ensure maritime security in the region, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on September 10.

            “Our Self-Defence Forces and the Indian Armed Forces have already conducted joint exercises this year
            between all services of land, sea and air. Our cooperative relationship is deepening steadily,” Mr. Kishida
            said to a question from The Hindu on India’s role in his new Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy.

            “For example, as we did last year, our maritime Self-Defence Forces and the Indian Navy engaged in joint
            exercises this July and the Japan-Australia-India-U.S. Quad joint drill Malabar was also held on a
            continuous basis. So, going forward, to ensure the Indo-Pacific will not be a region that will be decided by
            force, and will be a region that values freedom and rule of law, we will continue active defence cooperation
            and exchanges with India.”
            Japan sees India as an “indispensable” partner in the Indo-Pacific and is keen to develop deeper defence
            cooperation to ensure maritime security in the region, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on September 10.


            “Our Self-Defence Forces and the Indian Armed Forces have already conducted joint exercises this year
            between all services of land, sea and air. Our cooperative relationship is deepening steadily,” Mr. Kishida
            said to a question from The Hindu on India’s role in his new Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy.

            force, and will be a region that values freedom and rule of law, we will continue active defence cooperation
            and exchanges with India.”
            Mr. Kishida stressed that Japan’s FOIP was “an inclusive and open concept and has no specific country in
            mind.”
            At the same time, he described “an increasingly harsh security environment in the region” and said Japan was
            “opposed to unilateral changes to the status quo in East and South China Seas”, and also “firmly condemned
            North Korean’s missile activities.”
            “The FOIP that Japan is promoting is a concept to uphold and reinforce a free and open international order
            based on rule of law in the Indo-Pacific region. And by doing so we aim to ensure peace and stability and
            prosperity in the entire region and ultimately across the world. That is the vision.”
            Mr. Kishida had announced his new FOIP plan during a visit to India in March this year. “As a concrete
            measure we announced the reinforcement of our support to maritime law enforcement capabilities and for
            maritime security,” he said. “In particular, India is an indispensable partner to realise a FOIP.”On
            September 9, commencing at 2:43 p.m. local time (6:13 p.m. JST) for approximately 20 minutes, Mr. KISHIDA
            Fumio, Prime Minister of Japan, who is visiting India to attend the G20 New Delhi Summit, held a Japan-India
            Summit Meeting with H.E. Mr. Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India. The summary of the meeting is as
            follows.
            At the outset, Prime Minister Modi expressed his welcome to Prime Minister Kishida’s visit to India, as well
            as his gratitude for Japan’s previous cooperation for the success of the G20 New Delhi Summit. He also
            stated that the fact that Japan is accomplishing economic growth under the leadership of Prime Minister
            Kishida is highly appreciated in India. In response, Prime Minister Kishida reiterated his gratitude for
            Prime Minister Modi’s attendance at the G7 Hiroshima Summit and his desire to pass on the outcome of the G7
            Hiroshima Summit to the G20 New Delhi Summit to contribute to its success. Furthermore, Prime Minister
            Kishida expressed his congratulations for the historic success of the landing of Chandrayaan-3 on the moon,
            and the two leaders concurred to work together in such areas as maintaining and strengthening a free and
            open international order based on the rule of law, as well as in the field of advanced technology, including
            space.
            Prime Minister Kishida stated that Japan-India relations have steadily progressed in recent years and called
            for cooperation in improving the investment environment in India toward the realization of the
            5-trillion-yen target of public and private investment and financing from Japan to India in the next five
            years, which was set in March last year. Both leaders welcomed that the provision of a 400-billion-yen loan
            for the construction project of the high-speed rail (V), a flagship project of Japan and India, is underway.
            The two leaders welcomed the various initiatives being taken for the “Japan-India tourism exchange year,”
            which was agreed on in March this year and concurred to continue to promote it in both countries. In
            addition, Prime Minister Kishida stated that coordination is underway to launch the Japanese Grant Aid for
            Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS), which will enable talented administrative officials who will
            play a leading role in Japan-India relations to study in Japan. In response, Prime Minister Modi expressed
            his gratitude.
            Prime Minister Kishida explained Japan’s position regarding the recently initiated discharge of ALPS treated
            water into the ocean.
            The two leaders concurred to work together to further strengthen bilateral relations.
