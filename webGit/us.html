            G20 Leaders' Summit wrapped up with enthusiasm in Delhi under India's presidency, the United States lauded
            it as an 'absolute success.'

            In a briefing on September 11, the US State Department's official spokesperson, Matthew Miller, told
            reporters, “We absolutely believe it was a success. The G20 is a big organisation. Russia is a member of the
            G20. China is a member of the G20."The "use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible," the G20
            nations stated on September 9 in a New Delhi Leaders' Declaration in the context of the Ukraine war.

            The New Delhi Declaration reaffirmed that the G20 is the premier forum for international economic
            cooperation, and the member countries acknowledged that the G20 is not the platform for geopolitical and
            security issues, although these issues can have consequences for the global economy.

            The G20 member countries called on all nations to respect core principles of international law. These
            principles include upholding territorial integrity, sovereignty, following international humanitarian laws,
            and supporting the multilateral system that helps maintain global peace and stability.The New Delhi
            Declaration reads, "The peaceful resolution of conflicts, and efforts to address crises as well as diplomacy
            and dialogue are critical. We will unite in our endeavour to address the adverse impact of the war on the
            global economy and welcome all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just, and
            durable peace in Ukraine that will uphold all the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter for the
            promotion of peaceful, friendly, and good neighbourly relations among nations in the spirit of ‘One Earth,
            One Family, One Future’."

            India made history by hosting the G20 Summit for the first time in New Delhi on September 9-10 and was
            marked by extensive preparations to showcase India's rich traditions and strengths. Throughout its
            presidency, India placed a strong emphasis on several critical issues, including promoting inclusive growth,
            fostering digital innovation, enhancing climate resilience, and ensuring equitable global health access.
            Indonesia held the G20 presidency in the previous year, and Brazil is slated to assume the presidency after
            India.
            the United States lauded it as an 'absolute success.' In a briefing on September 11, the US State
            Department's official spokesperson, Matthew Miller, told reporters, “We absolutely believe it was a success.
            The G20 is a big organisation.
