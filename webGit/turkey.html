            Türkiye attaches high importance to G20 as a forum bringing together advanced and emerging economies.
            Therefore, it actively supports to further develop G20 agenda.

            Türkiye was G20 President in 2015 and hosted Leaders’ Summit in Antalya on 15-16 November 2015. Turkish G20
            Presidency aimed to focus on developing more inclusive global growth, enhancing investments, and effectively
            implementing previous commitments. Therefore, Türkiye defined its G20 Presidency priorities with three “I”s,
            namely Inclusiveness, Investment, and Implementation.

            During Turkish G20 Presidency, G20 agreed on a target to reduce youth unemployment by 15% by 2025, adopted a
            set of policy recommendations to reduce inequalities and established Women20 as a full-fledged engagement
            group to promote gender inclusive economic growth. These actions contributed to create an inclusive economic
            growth within G20 members. Turkish G20 Presidency also focused to take steps towards creating an inclusive
            economic growth across the world. To this end, G20 Leaders adopted a framework in Antalya to strengthen the
            dialogue between G20 and low-income developing countries. Furthermore, Turkish Presidency placed development
            issues at the heart of its G20 agenda and concrete actions were agreed by G20 Leaders on food security, role
            of private sector in development and remittances. Türkiye also focused to assist SMEs particularly in terms
            of enhancing their access to finance and better integration to global value chains.

            Turkish G20 Presidency brought to the agenda of the Leaders issues related to global peace and security as
            these issues are highly related to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth. Therefore, G20 Leaders
            discussed fight against terrorism and refugee crises in Antalya. First time in G20 history, Leaders agreed
            on a strong statement on fight against terrorism as well as underscored the importance of solidarity and
            effective cooperation to tackle the refugee crisis.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday said
            India is his country's greatest trade partner in South Asia and expressed confidence of tapping the huge
            potential of cooperation between the two countries. Addressing a press conference after the conclusion of
            the G20 leaders' summit, Erdogan also said that on the sidelines of the summit, he held talks with Prime
            Minister Narendra Modi.
