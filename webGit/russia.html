            Russia welcomed the G20 summit declaration, which refrained from explicitly condemning Moscow for its
            actions in the Ukraine conflict.

            Russia expressed the view that the leaders of the G20 acted in the spirit of conflict resolution as
            discussions continued on Sunday, Reuters reported.

            As reported by Reuters, the consensus declaration, adopted in New Delhi on Saturday, did not directly
            criticize Russia for the war but instead urged all states to refrain from using force to acquire territory.
            Russia has characterized its actions in Ukraine as a "special military operation."

            "There were very difficult negotiations on the Ukraine issue; first of all, the collective position of the
            BRICS countries and partners worked, everything was reflected in a balanced form ...", Svetlana Lukash, the
            Russian G20 sherpa, or government negotiator, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Interfax.
            In the weeks leading up to the summit, the G20 nations faced difficulties in reaching a common agreement
            regarding the Ukraine conflict. Western countries pushed for a unified stance that would condemn Moscow for
            its invasion of Ukraine, while Russia maintained its position that it would veto any resolution that did not
            align with its perspective.
            "This was one of the most difficult G20 summits in the almost twenty-year history of the forum ... it took
            almost 20 days to agree on the declaration before the summit and five days here on the spot," Lukash said.

            "This was not only due to some disagreements on the Ukraine subject, but also due to differences in
            positions on all key issues, primarily the issues of climate change and the transition to low-carbon energy
            systems..."
            Reuters reported that a European Union official, who did not want to be identified, said on Sunday
            discussions on the G20 leaders' declaration went on until the last moment and the Ukraine war was the most
            contentious issue before a consensus was reached.
            The official commended India for its robust leadership and noted that Brazil and South Africa also made
            significant contributions during the negotiations.
            The summit, hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and attended by leaders like US President Joe Biden and
            British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, aims to strike a balance between the interests of the global south and
            those of the Western world.
            Ukraine's foreign ministry said the Delhi declaration was "nothing to be proud of", adding that a Ukrainian
            presence would have given participants a better understanding of the situation.
            The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022 resulted in a significant loss of life, the displacement of
            millions of people, and widespread economic disruptions globally. Moscow has consistently denied allegations
            of committing atrocities during the course of the conflict.
            Russia on Sunday deemed the G20 Summit in India’s capital New Delhi an “unconditional success,” a day after
            the meeting’s final declaration stopped short of explicitly condemning its invasion of Ukraine.

            Speaking at a press conference at the end of the summit, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the
            summit was a success not just for India but “for all of us.”

            The final group statement said “all states must refrain from the threat or use of force to seek territorial
            acquisition” without singling out Russia.

            In a reflection of the deep fractures among the G20 nations, the statement acknowledged “there were
            different views and assessments of the situation.”

            Diplomats had been working furiously to draft a final joint statement in the lead-up to the summit but hit
            snags on language to describe the Ukraine war.

            The eventual compromise statement amounted to a coup for the summit’s host, Indian Prime Minister Narendra
            Modi, but still reflected a position far softer those the United States and its Western allies have adopted
            individually.
