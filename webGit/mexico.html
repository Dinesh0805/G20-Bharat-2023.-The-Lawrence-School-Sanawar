            After two days of work at the G20 Leaders' Summit, held in New Delhi, India under the theme "One Earth, One
            Family, One Future," the delegation heads of the member and invited countries discussed the current
            geopolitical situation and its impact on the global economic recovery; reform of the international financial
            architecture, with special emphasis on the Multilateral Development Banks; and debt treatment programs for
            less developed countries.

            Mexico was represented by Economy Secretary Raquel Buenrostro on behalf of President Andrés Manuel López
            Obrador, and Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Carmen Moreno, as Mexico's G20 Sherpa.

            At this Summit, the G20 member countries agreed to extend an invitation to the African Union (AU) to join as
            a permanent member, in recognition of the need to give African countries a greater role in decision-making
            processes. On instructions from President López Obrador, Mexico joined the consensus to support the AU’s
            membership.

            Despite the polarization and geopolitical tensions, the G20 adopted the Leaders' Declaration, which
            recognizes the adverse consequences of the war in Ukraine on the rising food and energy prices, and its
            disruption of supply chains and global macroeconomic stability.

            Mexico contributed decisively to the negotiations and encouraged the leaders to recognize their commitments
            to increased financing for developing countries to help them implement the 2030 Agenda and mitigate the
            adverse effects of climate change.

            Mexico also achieved the inclusion of priority issues, including: the fight against poverty and inequality;
            inclusive development, with gender equality as a cross-cutting theme; the fight against trafficking in small
            arms and light weapons and against international illicit drug chains; the promotion of safe and regular
            migration; and increased cooperation to eradicate the trafficking of cultural property and the appropriation
            of the living cultural heritage of indigenous peoples, among others.

            On the sidelines of the G20 Summit, the leaders of MIKTA (Mexico, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Türkiye and
            Australia) commemorated the group’s tenth anniversary and issued a statement reiterating their commitment to
            peace, stability and stronger multilateralism.

            In her message, Secretary Buenrostro said that Mexico would coordinate MIKTA in 2024, promoting
            collaboration for social development, governance and a sustainable future as tools to combat poverty and
            inequality.

            Mexico congratulates the government of India for its leadership and commitment during its presidency of the
            G20 and wishes the greatest success to Brazil, which has become the Group’s president as of this date. Under
            the coordination of the Foreign Ministry, Mexico will continue its constructive and proactive participation
            in the G20, seeking more inclusive and sustainable development for the benefit of the most vulnerable
            people.
